# Craig Harshbarger

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Craig!

I specialize in leveraging my expertise in TypeScript and frontend frameworks to build seamless, high-quality user and developer experiences. With years of experience leading cross-functional teams and maintaining open-source projects, I have successfully guided numerous initiatives from concept to launch. Iâ€™m passionate about collaboration, learning, and mentorship, fostering an environment that drives productivity. Having worked remotely full-time since 2020, I thrive in adaptable, results-oriented settings.

I love building JavaScript applications, products, and librariesâ€”whether it's crafting SaaS products, designing data-fetching libraries, or writing CSS. While my primary focus is on frontend development with Vue and React, I'm also comfortable diving into backend work, writing APIs, and designing permission systems. I'm a TypeScript nerd, a Vue and React philosopher, and a DevX advocate. Some say it's either DevX or UXâ€”I want both.

I live in Rockford, IL, with my wife and kids. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing golf with my buddies or hiking through state parks with my family.
